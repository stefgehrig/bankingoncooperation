# bankingoncooperation
This script creates the tables, figures and summary statistics from the literature review presented in the manuscript:

+ Gehrig, S., Mesoudi, A., & Lamba, S. (2020). Banking on cooperation: An evolutionary analysis of microfinance loan repayment behaviour. *Evolutionary Human Sciences*.           
                                                              
The raw results of the literature review are the underlying data and are supplied in a separate file (`litreview_results.csv`). These are analysed in the script `litreview_results.R`, which produces `TableS2.csv` and `Figure2.png`.
